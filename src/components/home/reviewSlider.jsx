      "Firstly, it was a lot of fun to learn with Qurocity. The teaching process was perfect, and the tutor ensured I was thoroughly engaged. So I enjoyed it a lot! Their material helped me a lot too. Moreover, the platform is very organized and systematic. It was overall a great learning experience.",

      "The German course was very good. I also found it very convenient as I could attend the course per my schedule. As I am studying medicine in Germany my language knowledge came handy. My tutor, Disha, was kind enough to make adjustments many times so that I could easily recover whenever I missed a session. I am definitely satisfied!",
